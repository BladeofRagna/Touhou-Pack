Touhou Pack Changelog:
3.0.0
- Added the new "Touhou Customizer" program; replacing the now defunct fumo randomizer program (Known as Randomizefumos.exe). More info below!
- Fixed the form textures not loading correctly! ...Again... hopefully!
- Shifted around a lot of files both for organization sake (god knows this mod needs it) and the new program
- Shifted around lots of data for the mod.yml

Touhou Customizer Changelog:
1.0.0
- Initial Version
(Note: Currently disabling all textures and only using text is very inconsistent; some times various text files will not load so please be cautious!)

Not gonna bother writing what I did in prior versions, too many changes that went undocumented.
