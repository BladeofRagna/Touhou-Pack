# Touhou-Spritepack
A small set of sprite replacements for the commonly dropped orbs in KH2 on PC.

- Red P Tiles = HP Orbs
- Yellow Tiles = Munny
- Green Stars = Drive Orbs
- Pink Cherry Tiles = MP Orbs
- Blue Point Tiles = None. Haven't implemented them yet

Addtionally various useless items (Such as Auron's Statue) have been replaced with various Touhou Fumo Plushes!

There's also a secret change somewhere hidden (that totally isn't a left over of something planned)
